                I am currently a student of Computer Science at the State University of Northern Paraná
                and I am looking for my first opportunity as a freelancer or with a fixed job for a company
                as a Web developer or Frontend Developer. Since I was younger I started to work with computers
                and I developed an increasing interest in knowing how programs were made, what fundamentals and
                requirements to develop them. At the age of 14 I started to arouse interest in editing videos and
                images,
                since then, I started to research more deeply and specialize in design, learning about programming was
                the
                next step, because my goal was to unite both. When I entered the university in 2018, I decided to focus
                on
                the applications frontend, and for that I started studies in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, thus acquiring
                the
                necessary requirements to work in the area. Currently I work as a designer for companies, making
                promotional
                videos, flyers, banners and other projects, all involving editing.
